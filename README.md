# Hi there! Welcome to my alx-low_level_programming hub ðŸ‘‹

#### Are you an aspiring software developer and looking to get a grasp on c programming? Then this repo is for you!:fire:

## So here's the gist :blush:

Recently got in an internship with ALX Africa as an aspiring software developer, and one of the requirements was that we learn the C programming language. Over the coming months, I'll be using what I've learned to complete simple tasks. If you're also an aspiring software developer, you could use this repository as a starting point for your learning.:boom:
