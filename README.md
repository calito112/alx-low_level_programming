# Hi there!👋 Welcome to my alx-low_level_programming hub 🤝

#### Are you an aspiring software developer and looking to get a grasp on c programming? Then this repo is for you!🔥

## So here's the gist 😊

Recently got in an internship with ALX Africa as an aspiring software developer, and one of the requirements was that we learn the C programming language. Over the coming months, I'll be using what I've learned to complete simple tasks. If you're also an aspiring software developer, you could use this repository as a starting point for your learning.💥
